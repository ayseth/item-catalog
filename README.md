# Project: Item Catalog


### Project Overview

Develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.


### Why This Project?

Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and utilities to their users; but deep down, it’s really all just creating, reading, updating and deleting data. In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of building dynamic websites with persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a compelling service to your users.

### What Will I Learn?
> You will learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along > with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. You will then learn when to properly use 
> the various HTTP methods available to you and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read,
> update  and delete operations.
